Reporting issues
================

As MW4 adds more functionality, your feedback is highly welcome! To improve
quality and usability any feedback is highly welcome. To maintain a good transparency
and a doable work for my, please respect some recommendations how to feed back.

Please report back under: https://github.com/mworion/MountWizzard4/issues. 
This is good for any feedback (bug reports, other issues, usability, feature requests, etc).

In case of a bug report please have a good description (maybe a screenshot if it‘s related to GUI) and add the log file(s) to the issue. Normally you just could drop the log file (or PNG in case of a screen shot) directly to the webpage issue. In some cases GitHub does not accept the file format (unfortunately for example FITs files). I this case, please zip them and drop the zipped file. This will work. If you have multiple files, please don‘t zip them to one file if it‘s not necessary as I use the issue sheets for the structure itself and by counterchecking if have to maintain a second set of data (unpacked one) which is much work.

If changes are made due to a feedback, new releases will have a link to the closed issues on GitHub.
