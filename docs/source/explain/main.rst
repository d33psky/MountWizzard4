Main Window Tab
===============

Layout of main window
---------------------

After starting MW4 the first time you will see the main window. It consists of 4 areas to be
used:

.. image:: image/main_1.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 71%

Area 1: Devices and Windows
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
...describes the actual status of the important devices used in modeling (red shows
disconnected, green shows connected devices), and shows status text output from devices.
Buttons below the status indicators can open, show additional status, or close additional
windows for advanced features.

Area 2
^^^^^^
...shows actual computer time, UTC, and the actual profile. In header section there is
hint if MW4 work actually in online (internet connected) or offline mode.

Area 3
^^^^^^
...manages loading / saving profiles, boot and shutdown of the mount (if WOL (Wake on LAN)
is enabled and the MAC address of the mount is known)

Area 4
^^^^^^
...shows different tabs for different use cases.

MW4 comes uses tooltips which should help you understand which button or widget is used
for which purposes.

MW4 uses a direct IP connection to the mount computer. This can be done via ethernet cable
or wireless. An RS-232 connection is not supported! The IP connection is used heavily to
send and update data quickly, so there is real amount of traffic on this line.

.. note::
    Recommendation: If possible use MW4 with a wired IP connection (ethernet cable). This
    enables the WOL (wake on lan) function and has lower latency for the IP traffic. Using a
    bad WiFi connection might cause timeouts in communication.

When connected, MW4 is used for all functions (except the computer time shown in area 2) the
timebase of the mount. This is also valid for the UTC shown in area 2 as well for other
functions or data that use time. You can choose, how the time base of the mount is
tracked by using an NTP solution, the 10micron tool, or using GPS during boot also for time
update.

Mount tab
---------

.. image:: image/mount_tab.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 71%

Area 1: Pointing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Altitude (ALT) and azimuth (AZ) are shown in degrees. As soon as the mount is
connected, the mount tab shows the telescope pointing in hour angle (HA), right ascension
(RA), declination (DEC) in hours / degrees HMS/DMS as well in decimals. You can choose to
see the coordinates in JNow, the mount representation or in J2000 Epoch for better
compatibility with other programs. The handling of coordinates between MW4 and the mount
computer is done in JNow. But this is transparent when in use.

Area 2: Track and Flip
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In the tracking / flip section, the tracking can be switched on / off and if possible a flip
can be forced. The main tracking speed (lunar, solar or sidereal) is highlighted and can
be changed.

Parking / emergency stop puts the mount in park position or stops and movement immediately.

Area 3: Mount Status
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In Status and settings from the mount computer, many parameters are visible and can be altered.
Whenever you see a frame around a value, you can click on it to change the parameter.
Some of the parameters can only be changed if the mount is connected.

Environ Tab
-----------
If you have environment sensors connected and configured, you can see the overview in the
environment tab. The tab content is dynamic. The more connections you have, the more you
will see. The example below is the maximum MW4 can support.

.. image:: image/environ_tab.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 71%

Area 1: Data Sources
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Data of all different configured sources are shown here. If a source has no connection or
receives no data, the frame will turn red.

+----------+----------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| source   | device         | remarks                                             |
+----------+----------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| SkyMeter | Unihedron SQM  | for compensation it's gathering temperature as well |
+----------+----------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| Power    | Pegasus UPB1/2 | both version are supported                          |
+----------+----------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| Weather  | OpenWeatherMap | API needed, the pressure is at mount level !        |
+----------+----------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| Sensor   | MBox, MGBox    | if connected as INDI external device, compatibles   |
+----------+----------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| Direct   | MGBox          | if connected via GPS connector to mount             |
+----------+----------------+-----------------------------------------------------+

Area 2: Mount Refraction Data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This is the data the mount is working with. The mount box display shows the actual refraction
data the mount knows. You can set the refraction update method in this area or push the
data manually to the mount. Continuously means at any state, but filtered with a moving
average filter of 60s length. No tracking means updating whenever new data is acquired, but
only when the mount is not in a tracking state.

If no source for updating the refraction data is available, but needed, this part will turn
red. The update mode (to accept data at the mount) is set in the mount computer if "Direct"
source is selected or done through MW4 for all others sources.

Area 3: Online Forecast
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you have an online connection enabled, you could see the weather forecast for your
location from clearoutside. Thanks to these guys for agreeing on this integration. The location
is automatically set to the location of your mount.

Area 4: Source Selection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If a source frame has a checkbox, this source can be chosen for using it's data for the
refraction update. As you may have different options in this window, you have the choice to
pick a source.

Almanac Tab
-----------
MW4 assists you in getting some context information what's going on during the night imaging
conditions.

.. note:: The almanac populated only when the mount is connected

    :scale: 71%


Model Points Tab
----------------
Before starting the model build, you need to choose which set of reference points you would
like to use for your model. The model calculation is done by the mount computer itself. MW4
only automates the procedure for you. Generally speaking you should set your references points in
areas you might use for imaging later on. In a fixed setup, you should distribute points
equally over the sky. MW4 allows multiple choices to automatically select the reference points.

.. note:: The mount computer only processes max 100 points.

.. image:: image/model_points_tab.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 71%

Area 1: Reference Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The following type of placing the reference points in the hemisphere are available:

+-------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| type of reference | remarks                                             |
+-------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| file              | loading from a file                                 |
+-------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| grid              | grid in alt / az equally spaced                     |
+-------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| align             | subset of grid with 3 / 6 / 9 points                |
+-------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| greater circles   | references along ra / dec movements                 |
+-------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| golden spiral     | algorithm for placing it equally over hemisphere    |
+-------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| DSO tracks        | placing along dec movement from actual position     |
+-------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+

Sorting should be done automatically in a way to reduce slewing times.

Area 2: Horizon Management
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You might add a horizon mask to avoid placing reference points in positions where you have
obstacles in your sky view. When auto delete is checked, MW4 will remove automatically all
not visible reference points from modeling list. In addition you could choose a sorting of
your own, if you prefer or need different optimisations.


Model Build Tab
---------------
Starting / Stopping, status and the progress of modeling is shown on this tab. MW4 tries to
gives you some help to adjust the alignment easily, and the correct way.

.. image:: image/model_build_tab.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 71%

Area 1: Alignment Status
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Actual alignment model of the mount in use. It shows the parameters of the actual model and
it's errors regarding orthogonal and polar align.

Area 2: Model Build Progress
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Shows the modeling process and some estimations about timing of the overall process.

Area 3: Alignment Helper
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you are starting polar align, the deviations might be too big, such that focusing a reference
star might be impossible because this star is not within the FOV of the camera. The mount gives
you some hints how to tweak the mechanical setup to get you alignment. The pictures show you
the direction to turn based on a GM1000 mount in revolutions of these knobs.

.. warning:: After you changed you mechanical setup by turning knows on your mount, the
             mount model is invalid! You have to do a new model build process to get a valid
             one.

Area 4: Fast Align
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you simply want to readjust an existing model for a single reference point, you can
use plate solve sync model. Please take into account, that no new model is calculated, but
the existing model is shifted to match the actual reference point. This might lead to larger
errors in other areas of the sky. From my point of view it is not recommended to use this
type of model syncing. It is only useful if you need a quick align on a single point.

Area 5: Programming Models
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
For all the models you made with MW4, the necessary data is stored on your computer. With
this data you can reprogram the model without doing any imaging or plate solving process,
because it's already captured. MW4 can also combine multiple model setups to a new one.

This is a very powerful function: You can use it for reprogramming models you lost due to
mount error, or use it as a backup if you tweaked the model. But you can also combine
different types of models to possibly improve your model for certain use cases. For example
if you have a 50 point model for the overall sky, you could add a DSO track for you current
object to improve accuracy by modeling more points in your area of interest during this night.

Manage Model Tab
----------------
Once you have made a model or you have an actual model in the mount, MW4 will download the data
and the name list of all in the stored mount models. You then can work with this data.

.. image:: image/manage_model_tab.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 71%

Area 1: Model Errors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A polar diagram shows the distribution of the model points and it's errors. The errors are
absolute numbers.

Area 2: Optimizing Model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Once you have the model downloaded (which MW4 does automatically when starting up),
optimizations can then be done. There might be some really bad points in the model that you would like
to remove. You can also do it automatically until you reach a certain target RMS.

.. note::   It is not recommended to overshoot the optimization and only go for lowest
            numbers. As the model should reflect all deviations from reproducible errors to
            ground truth, the model errors are real.

Area 3: Models in Mount
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The 10micron mount can store a recent number of models internally. The actual active model
has no name. So loading or saving means loading a stored model to the actual space or saving
the actual space to a certain name. You can't save a model to disk. All models stored in the
mount itself, and will stay there. I do not know the maximum number, but over time it does not
make sense to keep every model. If you store models to disk, please refer to build
model: MW4 stored any build model to disk in parallel. So you can access the data even
without having the model stored in the mount computer.

How to use the manage model is described in :ref:`Managing Mount Models`.


Satellite Tab
-------------
The mount supports satellite tracking. There is a database in the mount (which can be
updated), from where you select the database.

MW4 works differently: As this satellite data is out-of-date within 2 weeks or less and looses
precision very quickly, it maintains the databases outside the mount and only programs the
single satellite data from a satellite you have selected. MW4 won't touch the internal
database.

.. image:: image/satellite_tab.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 71%

Area 1: Select Satellite Database
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
MW4 needs an online connection for updating the database. Still there will be data for
testing and experiencing the functions there, but this data will be out-of-date from the
beginning.

.. note::
    Satellite tracking data should be not older than some days. You will loose precision and
    might not see the satellite in your FOV. So internet connection is strongly recommended
    for using satellite tracking.

MW4 provides some recent online databases that you can select from. The satellites
in the database are shown in area 2.

Area 2: Select active Satellite
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
All available satellites are shown in this list in order of the satellite number. If there
is already a satellite selected in your mount, MW4 will retrieve this data and makes a
selection accordingly.

Selecting a new satellite out of this list will immediately program its data to the mount
computer and calculate the necessary data shown in area 3.

Area 3: Calculation and Data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The selected satellite data is shown. Please have a look at the age of the data. MW4 will
show in colors if that data is too old for good tracking. Some of the calculations (like the
actual satellite position is calculated by MW4, some of this data like Start / End time is
retrieved from mount computer. But you should not need to care about it. Once a correct data
set is calculated and is valid, the tracking commands (area 4) are enabled.

Area 4: Satellite Tracking
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
With the start of satellite tracking, the mount will slew directly to the satellite position in
orbit. If the satellite is below the horizon or your horizon limits, the mount will slew to the
point where the satellite will rise over horizon the first time and will wait for that moment.
As soon as the satellite rises, the mount will track the satellite.

Stop satellite track should stop tracking the satellite immediately. for some reasons this
might happen correctly as there is no dedicated mount commend for this behaviour. You might
need to "Stop" the mount or try it multiple times. This will be improved with future firmware
versions.

Power Tab
---------
If you have a Pegasus UPB (version 1 or version 2) configured, this tab will show up. It
enables you to review some data and uses the functionality of UPB directly from MW4.

.. image:: image/power_tab.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 71%

Area 1: Data UPB
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Most of the data and functions are available on this part.

Area 2: Changing UPB
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The functions / data in this area is adapted to the version of UPB and changes depending to
which version you have in use.

Relay Tab
---------

Should be added later.

Tools Tab
---------
MW4 provides some small tools to make life a little bit easier.

.. image:: image/tools_tab.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 71%

Area 1: Renaming FITS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
MW4 can rename FITS files (extension .fit or .fits) to a filename which is build from a
set of data out of the FITS header and a text string. This can be done through
subdirectories in batch mode.

.. warning::    MW4 renames the files directly without making a copy!

Area 2: Park Positions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In MW4 you could program up to 10 park positions under settings. You could recall them just
with a button press.

Area 3: Mount Moving
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
As normally with MW4 you don't use the key pad, you can slew the mount in different
directions at different speeds. A button press starts slewing and the mount moves as long as
you press stop or it reaches some limit.
