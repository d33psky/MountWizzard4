Installing MW4 on Astroberry RaspberryPi
========================================

I strongly recommend using the actual astroberry server https://www.astroberry.io
if you would like to use KSTars/EKOS and MountWizzard4 on a Raspi (3 or 4).

Under https://github.com/mworion/MountWizzard4/tree/master/support you will find
the necessary scripts to install MW4 directly under astroberry. Please download
the corresponding ZIP archive (AstroberryScripts.zip), make a working directory on
astroberry server, extract the archive there and run the install script.

For starting MW4, please start the run script. Basically that's all to do.


.. hint:: Actually astroberry is supported from MW4 version 2.1.3 on. It has some
          limitations in features: no support of 3D mount simulator and color
          debayer images.
