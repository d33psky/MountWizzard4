Installing RaspberryPi 3
========================

To get MW4 installed on RBP3 you will follow the instructions of Robert Lancaste (many
thanks to him fore this work!) on https://github.com/rlancaste/AstroPi3 with installing
AstroPi3 scripts. The installation procedure I describe is based on Raspbian Buster with
desktop. As this distribution already supports python 3.7 we should check this:

.. code-block:: python

    python3 --version
