Adding the camera
-----------------

For adding devices like the camera select the Sett. / Conf. tab in the main menu and there
select the devices tab. For the following explanation we would like to connect a camera, a
filter and adding a link to the mount as well. The mount link is only used for reading the
parameters of the mount driver of your setup (e.g. focal length, aperture).

In core devices select Setup f√ºr Camera. A popup shows up. Please fill in the ip address of
the INDI or ALPACA server, where your devices are connected to.

If you are using INDI, you search for INDI camera devices by clicking on the search
button. Once you finished searching by pressing OK button, a list of available devices will
be populated. From the list choose the device and finish the setup with OK button.

The selected camera will be highlighted green in the drop down menu and in the status as
well. Once you configured the camera, the selection list will be stored for later use. If
you want to disable the camera, please select device disabled in the menu.

MW4 will now try to connect to the device and show green light whenever a connection is
established.

Do the steps 1 - 5 for all devices you need to configure. All configuration are save when
leaving MW4 with Save/Quit button or just when saving the profile. You can add or change any
config later on at any time.
