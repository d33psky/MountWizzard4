Explaining Extended Windows
===========================
MW4 has some more windows to show and use. Some of them are necessary for full functionality
. These windows could be opened on the main window with dedicated button in the upper left
part described here: :ref:`Layout of main window`.

Message Window
--------------
.. image:: _static/window_message.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 71%

the message window shows all messages during the work of MW4. You could scroll through
the content and clear the window. All messages are logged in the logfile for later analyse
if needed. The window is sizable in height.

There is a video on youtube with some explanations: https://youtu.be/6jiCOqKgzZY

Measure Window
--------------
.. image:: _static/window_measure.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 71%

The measure windows supports displaying many different values if the measure device is used
(see :ref:`Devices Tab`). You could display up to 3 different charts in this window and
selecting the time range / update interval of the measures. Sources are:

.. list-table:: Measurement Values
    :widths: 25, 75
    :header-rows: 1

    *   - source
        - remarks
    *   - temperature
        - temperatures from sensors as well as dew temps
    *   - pressure
        - pressure from sensors
    *   - humidity
        - humidity from sensors
    *   - RA stability
        - shows deviations RA increments during tracking
    *   - DEC stability
        - shows deviations DEC increments during tracking
    *   - Sky Quality
        - SQM Value if a sensor is attached
    *   - Voltage
        - Output Voltages if Pegasus UPB is installed
    *   - Current
        - Output Currents if Pegasus UPB is installed

The time interval range varies from 1s ticks (makes 4 minute view) to 128s ticks (makes 9 hour
view) and they double every step in between. The window is sizable in width and height.

Hemisphere Windows
------------------
The hemisphere window is on of the central windows for model building. It is oriented to a
ALT/AZ view from your observation location.

    :align: center
    :scale: 71%

Hemisphere Full
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
It shows the horizon, the selected model points, celestial and slew paths for the mount,
align stars (for polar and ortho alignment) and much more.

.. image:: _static/window_hemisphere_full.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 71%

Hemisphere Slew
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you are in normal operation mode, clicking in the hemisphere window will open a popup
window to slew to the selected coordinates. The value of the coordinates of the mouse
pointer is shows under Views / Coords.

.. image:: _static/window_hemisphere_slew.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 71%

Hemisphere Points
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Once you added model build points, you will see the actual valid points numbered in the
hemisphere window. If Slew path is checked, the slew path between the points is shown. In
the picture below no "auto delete below horizon" is checked. Therefore some model points are
below the horizon line. If checked, MW4 will remove them automatically.

.. image:: _static/window_hemisphere_points.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 71%

Hemisphere Points Edit
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Changing the operation mode to "Edit Build Points" will change the point color to pink of all
points. Now you can add new build point with a left mouse click and remove point with a
right mouse click. When deleting, MW4 will search for the closest point to the mouse pointer.

Hemisphere Points Polar
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Beside the ALT/AZ view - which is the standard view for modeling - you can add a polar
diagram as well. It basically shows similar information. You can't edit point or horizon
line in the polar diagram !

    :align: center
    :scale: 71%

Hemisphere Horizon Edit
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Changing operation mode to "Edit Horizon Mask" will change the horizon color to pink. You
can now edit the horizon line like the model point with adding a point with left mouse click
and removing a point with right mouse click. If you don't need a horizon mask, simply switch
it of by unchecking "Horizon Mask" on the top.

Image Windows
-------------
With the image window you could follow the imaging process during model build which runs
normally in background. If necessary you could do single or continuous exposures with the
parameters set under Setting/Imaging in the main window. The image window could also be used
as fits viewer. It loads the FITS file and shows the main FITS header keywords on the left
side. You are able to plate solve this image when a plate solver is configured. MW4 show
images in b/w, colored images will be debayered but also shown in b/w.

The continuous exposure mode (Expose N) enables imaging while adjusting the mechanical
setting of the mount (e.g. for polar alignment). A cross hair and grid is available. When
"Auto solve" is checked every received or loaded image is plate solved automatically. If
"Embed Data" is checked as well, the solving result will be written in the header of the
FITS image.

.. warning:: The will be no copy of the image saved. The data is saved is the original
             image header!

When using the continuous exposure mode, MW4 will stack the received images when "Stacking"
is checked. There is no alignment routine behind the scene working. It's a quick adding
images and calculating mean routine. So good stacking results rely on the tracking quality
of the mount.

Image Distortion Coordinates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you have a FITS image with distortion parameters stored in the FITS header or you add
them by plate solving and embedding the parameters yourself, MW4 can show the image with
distortion parameters used.

.. hint:: Some plate solvers calculate the coordinates of the images, but no distortion
          parameters! For example astrometry.net does calculate them, whereas ASTAP does not!

Satellite Windows
-----------------
The satellite window is split in four quadrants. The left side shows the the earth fixed and
rotating, the right side the earth map and your horizon view (like the hemisphere view) with
your horizon line (if checked). Red dots show your location.

    :align: center
    :scale: 71%

Satellite Visible
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you have an active satellite (selecting in satellite tab in main window), MW4 will show
the satellite track and position in all quadrants. Satellite position is cyclic updated,
so you could see the satellite moving. If the satellite is visible and above horizon, you
will see it's track in the fourth quadrant.

Satellite Visible Turned
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In the satellite windows you can change the perspective for the left quadrants showing the
earth by clicking in the window, holding the left mouse button and shifting tilt etc.

Keypad Window
-------------
The keypad window is just a copy of the original virtual keypad or the web based keypad on
newer firmware version (starting with firmware 2.16.11).
