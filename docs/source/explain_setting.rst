Explaining MW4 Settings
=======================
In the main window the last tab called "Sett. / Conf." points to menu where all the settings
for MW4 could be configured. It is like the main window split into multiple Tabs.

Devices Tab
-----------
The devices tab is the central point for MW4 to define the devices, which are used within
the program. Drop down lists let you select the appropriate device source or disable it.
Disabled devices might occur gray in the menu or are even removed (like Relay or Power)

The drop down lists are colored in green, whenever a device could be connected. A status
change could take some seconds to connect to a server or to start runtime. There is no need
to get all devices populated if not needed.

The following different device types are present:

+--------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| type of device     | remarks                                             |
+--------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| device disabled    | disabling device usage                              |
+--------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| Built-In           | functionality is built in MW4                       |
+--------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| indi               | device is connected to an INDI server               |
+--------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| alpaca             | device is connected to an ASCOM ALPACA server       |
+--------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| Astrometry         | shows local programs like ASTAP, astrometry.net     |
+--------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+

A snoop device is only read for information, but not needed for active functions.

Some of the devices have a setup button. When selecting, a popup window will show up. You
have to make selections for an INDI server:

    :align: center

For the INDI configuration you could search for devices of the given type and select them
via drop down menu. In addition you could copy the settings for host address, host port,
showing indi messages in main message window to all INDI devices.

MW4 supports ASCOM ALPACA as well:

    :align: center

For ALPACA you setup the parameter accordingly. Like in INDI you could copy the protocol,
host address, host port, user and password to all other alpaca device.


Imaging Tab
-----------
The imaging tab is central setup for all things related to gather images.

.. image:: _static/explain_sett_imaging_tab.png
    :align: center

Area 1: Imaging Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The most important functions needed for the camera, cooler, filter wheel is set there. Some
of the functions are only available when your device supports it (like ISO, sub frame etc.).

Area 2: Image handling
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You could enable fast download of images from your camera (3) - if supported and decide and
check if you would like to keep the images from model build on your disk. Normally all data
after a model build is stored anyway. So if you dont need the images for analyse later,
there is no need for keep them.

Area 3: Imaging Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Parameters of you imaging train are collected, calculated and shown there. For accessing all
parameters, MW4 needs the telescope snooping set and the parameters set in your INDI server.

Area 4: Imaging Quality
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Out of literature there are some known quality parameters, which MW4 calculates for you. It
might help you in choosing the right setup, it's for information only.

Area 5: Solver
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
There aren't much setting for the solver to be made. MW4 uses external programs for plate
solving an image. You should set the search radius and the solving timeout. Good value are
30 degrees for radius and 30 seconds for timeout.

Mount / Weather Tab
-------------------
.. image:: _static/explain_sett_mount_tab.png
    :align: center

Area 1: Mount Connectivity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
For MW4, the mount has to be connected via an IP connection. A serial link is not supported!

.. note::
    I recommend a wired connected (ethernet cable) as there is heavy communication with the
    mount computer when running a rich feature set.

You could enter the ip address numerical but as well in general host name string. Once you
connect the mount and booted it manually, the MAC address field and the connection type will
be populated automatically. If you enabled wake on lan (WOL) for booting the mount, MW4 from
then on could boot the mount with this command.

.. note::
    Wake on lan functionality is only available on a wired connection and if you mount
    computer and the device your are running MW4 on is in the same subnet of you network.

Area 2: Mount Settle Time
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
After slewing your setup might need some time for settle before starting imaging again. With
this parameter you could choose the waiting time.

Area 3: OpenWeatherMap API
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Open Weather delivers a free forecast of the environment conditions based on your location.
You could apply for an API key there: https://openweathermap.org. As out of now for the
basic service it's free of charge and Open Weather delivers refraction data for your location.
To enable the service within MW4, you have to enter your API key.

Area 4: Computer on rig
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you have a computer on your rig, which could be booted via wake on lan as well, you could
enter the MAC address here and remote boot this computer from MW4. There are the same
limitations for WOL like for the mount.

Dome / Cover Tab
----------------
MW4 could handle a dome which is connected via INDI.

.. image:: _static/explain_sett_dome_tab.png
    :align: center

Area 1: Dome geometry
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If a dome is connected and as device setup, MW4 will slew the dome to the azimuth, the mount
is slewed to automatically. If you own an all sky dome this is sufficient. In other setups
there is the need to calculate the right dome opening for the appropriate geometry in your
setup. In this case, please check the enable geometry calculations box and setup the geometry
parameters of your dome and the position of your mount in relation to the dome. If you think
of the center point of the dome as a hemisphere, the distances (offsets) from your mount to
this point have to be entered. The base point of the mount is the center of the mount
adapter ring.

For setting up the GEM and OTA offset the picture (3) should help you. There is no need for
setting both of them. GEM offset is the more known parameter whereas OTA offset might be
easier to measure. As they are dependant on each other, MW4 will calculate the other
parameter automatically for you.

Area 2: Dome Settle time
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
After moving your dome, your setup might need some time for settle before starting imaging
again. With this parameter you could choose the waiting time.

Area 4: Cover
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you have a telescope cover device setup, you could open and close your cover.

Park Position Tab
-----------------
MW4 stores up to 10 different park positions for you. You could setup these positions with
text (the text will be displayed in the tools menu), and altitude and azimuth for the
position.

.. image:: _static/explain_sett_dome_tab.png
    :align: center

The fill in button in each line allows to directly set altitude and azimuth of the actual
position in the according fields.

Audio / Misc Tab
----------------
.. image:: _static/explain_sett_misc_tab.png
    :align: center

Area 1: Internet Connection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You could tell MW4 to get online and update data or stay in unconnected mode. There are some
functions, which need an online connection to work properly:

+--------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| function           | remarks                                             |
+--------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| open weather map   | downloading weather data                            |
+--------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| satellite          | update satellite TLE elements                       |
+--------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| deltaT updates     | update time base for calculations                   |
+--------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| MW4 updater        | accessing pypi.org for updates                      |
+--------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+

Area 2: Updater
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
MW4 is able to handle updates via the python package management. You see the actual
installed version and the available version. Pressing install will update MW4. You need to
restart MW4 to run the new version.

MW4 offers to install alpha or beta releases as well. If you would like to do so, please
check the according box.

Area 3: Firmware Data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Actual firmware data is collected and shown in this are.

Area 4: Logging Levels
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
As MW4 is not perfect things might happen and to review the situation and review it, MW4
writes log files. For all release versions information setting is ok, for alpha and beta
version debugging should be set. The log file could become big as MW4 tries to log all data
needed for bugfixing.

.. note::
    If you experience problems or want to file a bug, please attach the log file from your
    work directory. The best way to file a problem is to open an issue on:

    https://github.com/mworion/MountWizzard4/issues.

    Please take the time for a explanation what happened and drop the log file to this issue
    as well. It's easy to do and the size of the log file should not matter. Using issues on
    GitHub help me to improve MW4.

Area 5: Audio Signals
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
MW4 could play audio signals for some events to giv you an audio feedback what is happening.
Event and audio could be setup.
