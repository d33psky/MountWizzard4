MountWizzard4
=============

Overview
--------
Welcome to MountWizzard4! MW4 is a utility for 10micron users for improving the workflow for
astronomy work and imaging runs on Windows, OSx and Linux (Ubuntu tested). As a python
application, it should run in all environments which support python3.7 including
Qt as a Gui framework.

For full operation MW4 needs actually running INDI Server(s) (see: https://indilib.org)
connected to your devices. MW4 will support ASCOM Alpaca
(see: https://ascom-standards.org/Developer/Alpaca.htm) in the next step as well. In
addition an online connection is used for some services which might be very helpful.

It is recommended to use mount firmware 2.16 or later as some of the functions don't work
with older firmware versions.
