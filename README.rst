MountWizzard4
=============

Welcome to MountWizzard4 is a utility for 10micron users for improving the workflow for
astronomy work and imaging runs on Windows, OSx and Linux (Ubuntu 18.04 tested). As a 
python application, it should run in all environments supporting python3.6-3.8 and PyQt5
as a GUI framework.

.. note:: Please check these pages for some hints to your installation:
          https://mountwizzard4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/issues.html

For being fully operational, MW4 needs either:

INDI server(s) (see: https://indilib.org) where your devices are connected to.

INDIGO server(s) (see: http://www.indigo-astronomy.org) where your devices are connected to.

ASCOM Alpaca remote server (see: https://ascom-standards.org/Developer/Alpaca.htm)
abstracting your ASCOM devices or devices which speak native ASCOM Alpaca if you want to
connect over IP with your environment.

For the core devices there is fom 0.150.16 on native ASCOM support (Windows platform only).
Please be reminded, that ASCOM has 32bit and 64bit driver implementations and MW4 could also
be installed in 32bit or 64 bit python environment. They could be not be mixed! 32bit python 
supports only 32bit drivers and vice versa. Normally this should not be an issue...

In addition an online connection is used for some services which might be very helpful.

It is recommended to use mount firmware 2.16 (ideally 2.16.11) or later as some of the
functions don't work with older firmware versions. It should not be a problem using older
versions. A HW pre2012 might also have some issues.
