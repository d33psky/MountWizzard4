MountWizzard4
=============

Overview
--------
Welcome to MountWizzard4! MW4 is a utility for 10micron users for improving the workflow for
astronomy work and imaging runs on Windows, OSx and Linux (Ubuntu tested). As a python
application, it should run in all environments which support python3.7 including
Qt as a Gui framework.

For full operation MW4 needs actually running INDI Server(s), connected to your devices. In
addition an online connection is used for some services which are helpful, but not necessary.
MW4 will support ASCOM Alpaca in the next step as well.

It is recommended to use mount firmware 2.16 or later as some of the functions don't work
with older firmware versions.
